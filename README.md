# React Course

## Remindders:

### This will create a new folder:

- Remember to install npm (npm install) in every folder.
- `npm start` or `npx react-scripts start` to start the server

### If you do not want to create a new folder:

1. Navigate to the desired folder.
2. Initialize a new npm project: `npm init -y`
3. Install the necessary React dependencies: `npm install react react-dom react-scripts`
4. Create required files and folders for a React app if not already present.
5. Add or ensure the required scripts are in the package.json of the current directory:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
}
```
