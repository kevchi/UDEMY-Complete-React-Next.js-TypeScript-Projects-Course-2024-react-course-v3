# React Course

## Reminders:

### This will create a new folder:

Remember to navigate to the desired folder then:

- Install npm in the project directory: `npm install`
- Create the folder: `npx create-react-app@latest PREFERRED-DIRECTORY-NAME`
- once the dependencies are installed run: `npm start` or `npx react-scripts start`

### If you do not want to create a new folder:

1. Navigate to the desired folder.
2. Initialize a new npm project: `npm init -y`
3. Install the necessary React dependencies: `npm install react react-dom react-scripts`
   or
   if that does not work, try `npm install react react-dom react-scripts @babel/core @babel/preset-react --save`
4. Remember to add or ensure the required scripts are in the package.json of the current directory:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
}
```

5. Remember to add these additional required fields to your package.json:

```
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
```

6. Create required files and folders for a React app if not already present.
7. After setting these up, try running: `npm start`
